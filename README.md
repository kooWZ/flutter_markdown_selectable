# flutter_markdown_selectable
 A fork of flutter_markdown that supports the SelectionArea widget

## SelectionArea
`SelectionArea` is a widget introduced in flutter 3.3 that makes text selection "global" instead of "local" as implemented in widgets like `SelectableText`. This fork updates flutter_markdown to use this new feature.
